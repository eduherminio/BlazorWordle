[![GitHub Actions][githubactionslogo]][githubactionslink]

A simple implementation of Wordle game in Blazor, forked from [alexeychuvagin/BlazorWordle](https://github.com/alexeychuvagin/BlazorWordle).

- The design and idea of the game are taken from the original game, which you can find [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
- This implementation doesn't contain all the features of the original one

[Play the game](https://eduherminio.github.io/BlazorWordle/)
